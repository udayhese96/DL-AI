# Assignment 1: 8-Puzzle Problem

This assignment implements Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) to solve the 8-puzzle problem.

## Problem Statement
The 8-puzzle problem is a sliding tile puzzle where the goal is to arrange the tiles in numerical order with one blank tile.

## Search Algorithms Implemented
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Breadth First Search (BFS)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `8_puzzle_dfs.py` for DFS solution.
3. Run the `8_puzzle_bfs.py` for BFS solution.
