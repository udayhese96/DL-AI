# Assignment 2: Constraint Satisfaction Problem

This assignment focuses on implementing a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) solver.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to solve a problem using constraints to limit possible solutions. This is commonly used in scheduling, coloring maps, or solving puzzles.

## Algorithms Implemented
- Backtracking search
- Constraint propagation

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `csp_solver.py` to see the solution for the constraint satisfaction problem.
