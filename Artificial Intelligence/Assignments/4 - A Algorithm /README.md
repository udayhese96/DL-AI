# Assignment 4: A* Algorithm

This assignment implements the A* algorithm for solving a specific application problem.

## Problem Statement
The A* algorithm is used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph. This assignment demonstrates its use in solving pathfinding problems.

## Algorithm
- A* Search with heuristic function

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `a_star.py` to see the A* algorithm in action.
