# Assignment 8: Backward Chaining Algorithm

This assignment implements the Backward Chaining algorithm for reasoning and decision-making.

## Problem Statement
The Backward Chaining algorithm is used in inference, where the goal is to prove a given query by working backward through known rules and facts.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `backward_chaining.py` to see the Backward Chaining algorithm in action.
