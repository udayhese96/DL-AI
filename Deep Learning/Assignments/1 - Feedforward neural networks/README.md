# Assignment 1: Feedforward Neural Networks using Keras and TensorFlow

## Overview
This assignment implements feedforward neural networks (FNN) using Keras and TensorFlow. It demonstrates how to create, train, and evaluate a simple FNN model for a classification task.

## How to Run
- Install the required libraries: `pip install tensorflow keras`.
- Run the script to train and evaluate the neural network.

## Files
- `feedforward_nn.py`: Implementation of the feedforward neural network.
