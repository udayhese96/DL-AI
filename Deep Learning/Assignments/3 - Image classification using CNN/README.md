# Assignment 3: Image Classification using CNNs

## Overview
This assignment uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images into multiple categories. The CNN architecture is built using Keras and TensorFlow.

## How to Run
- Install the required libraries: `pip install tensorflow keras`.
- Run the script to train the CNN model on an image dataset and classify images.

## Files
- `cnn_image_classification.py`: CNN implementation for image classification.
