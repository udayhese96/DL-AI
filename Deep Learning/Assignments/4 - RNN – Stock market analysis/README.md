# Assignment 4: Time Series Prediction using RNN

## Overview
This assignment demonstrates how to use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict time series data, such as stock market prices or weather patterns.

## How to Run
- Install the required libraries: `pip install tensorflow keras`.
- Run the script to train the RNN model and perform time series prediction.

## Files
- `rnn_time_series.py`: Implementation of RNN for time series prediction.
