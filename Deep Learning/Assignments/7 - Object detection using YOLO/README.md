# Assignment 7: Object Detection using YOLO and Pretrained Models

## Overview
This assignment demonstrates object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm and pretrained models. It detects objects in images and classifies them into predefined categories.

## How to Run
- Install the required libraries: `pip install opencv-python`.
- Download the YOLO pretrained weights.
- Run the script to detect objects in images using YOLO.

## Files
- `yolo_object_detection.py`: YOLO-based object detection implementation.
